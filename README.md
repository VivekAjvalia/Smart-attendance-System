attendance tracking system that utilizes the latest technologies such as Internet 
of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. 

The system enables the automation of attendance tracking in educational 
institutions and workplaces. It involves the use of fingerprint sensor R307, to 
capture attendance data and store it in local database but first you must enrol 
then only it will capture and compare your fingerprint within its database.

The local database is in the fingerprint sensor itself which then is connected to 
the cloud using IFTTT.

Whenever it senses a fingerprint, it compares with all fingerprint in database 
and if found a HTTP request is sent to IFTTT which then adds a new row with 
information of the user in the Google Cloud.

The system provides real-time attendance updates, reduces administrative 
workload, and eliminates the need for manual attendance tracking, which can 
be time-consuming and prone to errors. The use of cloud computing ensures 
that attendance data is secure, reliable, and easily accessible.

The system is user-friendly, easy to install, and cost-effective, making it an ideal 
solution for organizations that want to improve their attendance tracking 
systems.
